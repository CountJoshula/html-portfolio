<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>I am Count Joshula</h2>
<p> That is right I have the legal title of a count. In 2017 I started on a self development journey that changed my life. Since then I have read over 100 books on the subject of dating, psychology, and philosophy.</p>

<p>Since 2017 I changed career path to a content creator and full time writer on both English and Japanese Quora.</p>

<p>When I started writing I never was doing it for the money but to help people. This is why none of my Quora answers are monetized and I don't sell products to people.</p>
